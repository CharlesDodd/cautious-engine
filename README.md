An app to experiment with Cryptography and Seganography
https://inventwithpython.com/cracking/

The gui for this app is made in Tkiner and so has been sorely limited.

Inspired by Cracking Codes With Python (see link above), the first page allows the user to:

-Select a text file they wish to encrypt

-Enter an encryption (/decryption) key

-Run either an encryption or decryption using the vigenere cipher over an extended alphabet

-Run a "one time pad", the key for which will be saved for use in decryption

The Steganography page will be used to:

-Select an image (colour / black and white) to hide

-Select a cover image (When hiding a black and white image the cover image can be up to the same size. The colour images must be samller)

-Save Images

-Reveal recieved images
