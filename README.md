An app to experiment with Cryptography and Steganography
https://inventwithpython.com/cracking/

This project was started without any form of version control, as such it is waiting to be cleaned up.

The gui for this app is made in Tkinter.

Inspired by Cracking Codes With Python (see link above), the first page allows the user to:

-Select a text file they wish to encrypt

-Enter an encryption (/decryption) key

-Run either an encryption or decryption using the vigenere cipher over an extended alphabet

-Run a "one time pad", the key for which will be saved for use in decryption

The Steganography page will be used to:

-Select an image (colour / black and white) to hide

-Select a cover image (When hiding a black and white image the cover image can be up to the same size. The colour images must be samller)

-Save Images

-Reveal recieved images
