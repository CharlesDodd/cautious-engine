# cautious-engine
An app to experiment with Cryptography and Steganography
https://inventwithpython.com/cracking/

The gui for this app is made in Tkinter.

Inspired by Cracking Codes With Python (see link above), the first page allows the user to:

-Select a text file they wish to encrypt

-Enter an encryption (/decryption) key

-Run either an encryption or decryption using the vigenere cipher over an extended alphabet

-Run a "one time pad", the key for which will be saved for later use

The Steganography Part of the GUI has been completed and uploaded seperately. This facilitates the hiding of one image inside another usiing the LSB method. One can hide a black and white image of the same size or a smaller colour image.

Due to the use of LSB, make sure to save images as PNG! 

This project was started without any form of version control, as such it is waiting to be cleaned up.
